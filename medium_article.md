# Analyzing Credit Card Transactions with SQL: Unveiling Spending Patterns

## Introduction

In the digital age, understanding consumer behavior is paramount, and one rich source of insights is credit card transactions. This project delves into the world of credit card data, leveraging SQL queries on an SQLite database to unearth patterns, trends, and demographics within transactional information.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project stemmed from a curiosity about the stories hidden in credit card transactions. Analyzing spending habits, identifying popular expenditure types, and understanding regional variations in spending became the driving force behind the endeavor.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** The project relies on SQL for its powerful querying capabilities. The primary database management system used is SQLite, providing a lightweight and efficient platform for analysis.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises crucial fields, including:
- City
- Date
- Card Type
- Expenditure Type
- Gender
- Amount

This structure lays the foundation for comprehensive analysis, enabling insights into various facets of credit card usage.

## Key Insights

### Total Expenditure

The fundamental question of how much has been spent overall is addressed with a simple SQL query, providing a holistic view of the financial activity captured in the dataset.

### City-wise Analysis

The project further explores city-wise expenditure, identifying locations with the highest and lowest total and average expenditures. This analysis unveils intriguing patterns in spending behavior across different regions.

### Card Type Comparisons

By categorizing transactions based on card types, the project offers a comparison of spending among different cards. It sheds light on whether certain card types are associated with higher or lower expenditures.

### Gender-based Spending Insights

Gender plays a role in shaping spending habits. The project dissects expenditures by gender, providing insights into how men and women differ in their credit card usage.
